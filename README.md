# M68k+ Amiga/based - Hybrid development mainboard
Technical raw modular optimized mainboard for freed and featureful developments<br>
<br><br>
# About: HyDMB
This public domain content object and project "HyDMB" is serviced for further development by all.<br>
It presents the important fact of fusion and merge with native and hybrid solutions for more time in development<br>
and use of the machines.<br>
<br>
# Explanation: HyDMB
The core, the Computer/Mainboard is to build/produce at current state by the presence of many solutions<br>
in a hybrid way as one development mainboard/computer.<br>
This is a theoretical proposal for users and developers of M68k Amiga/based and compatible solutions.<br>

# Hint: HyDMB
Motorola Computer Architecture is no more developed any more, the Amiga++ Software and Hardware is commonly<br>
not the actual state of technologies. Software on mass is needed, hardware too and more.<br>
All the intensive development work done and to do now and in future is best merged in a stablized fusion at best,<br>
for all projects and developers + users.
