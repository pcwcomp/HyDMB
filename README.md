# M68k+ Amiga/based - Hybrid development mainboard
Technical raw modular optimized mainboard for freed and featureful developments<br>
<br><br>
# Explanation of HyDMB:
The core, the Computer/Mainboard is to build/produce at current state by the presence of many solutions in a hybrid way as one development mainboard/computer.<br>
This is a theoretical proposal for users and developers of M68k Amiga/based and compatible solutions.<br>
At the moment no hardware gets build/created.<br>
