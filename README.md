# About: HyDMB
This public domain content object and project "HyDMB" is serviced for further development by all.<br>
It presents the important fact of fusion and merge with native and hybrid solutions for more time in development<br>
and use of the machines.<br>
<br>
# Explanation: HyDMB
The core - the Computer-Mainboard is to build/produce at current state by the presence of many solutions<br>
in a hybrid way as one development-product.<br>
This is a theoretical proposal for users and developers of M68k Amiga/based and compatible solutions.<br>
<br>
# Hint: HyDMB
Motorola Computer Architecture is no more developed any more, the Amiga++ Software and Hardware is commonly<br>
not the actual state of technologies. Software on mass is needed, hardware too and more.<br>
All the intensive development work done and to do now and in future is best merged in a stablized fusion at best,<br>
for all projects and developers + users.<br>
<br>
# Opinion: HyDMB
The reliable best solution is to set a open(-source) user friendly development mainboard free in the amiga<br>
development-universe including stabelizing, corrections and advancements in a modular functional layout.<br>
Its better to build a foundation and renewed compilation-like devel-mainboard and further developments.<br>
<br>
More, Procwork-Computer.com as its self has the opinion -> Fuse/Merge the best off all and any by legal correctness<br>
to a (re-)new development mainboard with hybrid technologies.
